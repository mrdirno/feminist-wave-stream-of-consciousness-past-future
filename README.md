## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a chapter where Clara touches a historical object in a museum and experiences a day in the life of its (female) maker.
- Create a 'recipe' from Clara's mother for understanding a non-water element (stone, fire, air).
- Write a stream-of-consciousness piece from the perspective of the lighthouse keeper's wife in Chapter 3.
- Introduce a new character—an older man who also hears the Undertow, but interprets it as madness or radio signals.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive 'Echo Map' of the town, where clicking locations triggers audio/visual fragments of Clara's visions.
- Create a generative text tool that mimics the novel's style: input a sensory detail (e.g., 'cold iron'), output a stream-of-consciousness memory flash.
